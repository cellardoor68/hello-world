# hello-world
Wow! Here commenceth the time-honored tradition in developing. To quote my friend HB, "Huzzah!"
A little about me: a few moments ago, while I was working through my first GitHub tutorial after just joining the website, my account was flagged and made private for some reason. I guess I should look into that via Contact Support, but for now I guess I can edit in private? I will not be hindered from my new development learning! And no, I'm not a robot.
